# ORM

ORM is a object-relation-mapper for Xojo applications. It is fast, consise, lightweight and secure!

## What's so great about it?

* It is database-independant ;
You may fetch a model from a database and save it in another if that pleases you! Also, basic SQL is used, so it is compatible with pretty much any database supported by Xojo ;
* It is secure: all values are processed and quoted against SQL injections ;
* It is elegant: it implements closures for doing builder-like syntax, function parameters and name are consistent and exploit ParamArray and Pair ;
* It is fast and memory efficient: do not fear an overheap, ORM is nearly stateless and does not load unecessary ; information.
* it is based on native class such as RecordSet, Database ;
* it is database independant ;
* it is unit-tested and shall not break! 
* it is event-driven ;
* ORM and QueryBuilder inherit from Control and are fully qualified as such ;
* it is extensively documented.
